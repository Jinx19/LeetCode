### 127.Word Ladder

  
Given two words \(_beginWord_and_endWord_\), and a dictionary's word list, find the length of shortest transformation sequence from_beginWord_to_endWord_, such that:

1. Only one letter can be changed at a time.
2. Each transformed word must exist in the word list. Note that
   _beginWord_
   is
   _not_
   a transformed word.

**Note:**

* Return 0 if there is no such transformation sequence.
* All words have the same length.
* All words contain only lowercase alphabetic characters.
* You may assume no duplicates in the word list.
* You may assume
  _beginWord_
  and
  _endWord_
  are non-empty and are not the same.
