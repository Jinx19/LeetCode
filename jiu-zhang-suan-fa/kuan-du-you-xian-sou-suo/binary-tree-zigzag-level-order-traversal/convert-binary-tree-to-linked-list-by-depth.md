# Convert Binary Tree to Linked List By Depth



description: 

Given a binary tree, design an algorithm which creates a linked list of all the nodes at each depth \(e.g., if you have a tree with depth D, youâ€™ll have D linked lists\).

Example 

Given binary tree:

> 1 
>
>    /    \ 
>
>  2     3 
>
> / 
>
> 4

> \[ 1-&gt; null,
>
>   2-&gt;3-&gt;null,
>
>   4-&gt;null,\]
